			<h1>What is Pascal's Triangle?</h1>
			<p>Pascal's Triangle is a triangle of numbers with many uses in math. Starting with a 1 surrounded by zeros, each number is found by adding the two above it.</p>
			<p>The first 5 rows of Pascal's Triangle:</p>

			<p>Pascal's Triangle has many useful properties and interesting patterns, which are described throughout this website.</p>
			<h1>Uses in Math:</h1>
			<h3>Binomial Coefficients</h3>
			<p>One property of Pascal's Triangle is that the rows represent coefficients of a binomial expansion. In other words, if you raise the binomial <i>(a + b)</i> to the power of <i>n</i>, the coefficients form the same sequence as row <i>n</i> of Pascal's Triangle.</p>
			<p>For example, (a + b)<sup>2</sup> works out to 1(a<sup>2</sup>) + 2(a<sup>1</sup>b<sup>1</sup>) + 1(b<sup>2</sup>). Row 2 of Pascal's Triangle is 1 2 1.</p>
			
			<h3>Combinatorics</h3>
			<p>Another cool thing about Pascal's triangle is that it directly represents the probability formula n choose k- often written as <i>nCk</i>. </p>
			<p><i>x = nCk</i> means that if you have a set of <i>n</i> things, there are <i>x</i> possible subsets of size <i>k</i>.</p>
			<p>For example, if I am selecting people from a group of 4- let's call them A, B, C, and D- there are 4 possible choices when I choose only one person.</p>
			<p>If I choose a group of two people, there are 6 possibilities- AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, and CD.</p>
			<p>The connection to Pascal's Triangle is simple- to find <i>nCk</i>, just check the number at row <i>n</i>, item <i>k</i> of the Triangle.</p>
			<p>*Remember that the first row, which is just a 1, is row 0, and the first item of every row is item 0.</p>
			<p></p>
			<h3>But Why?</h3>
			<p>So why does Pascal's Triangle have so many different applications?</p>
			<p>It may seem like a crazy coincidence, but all of these can be traced back to one particular property- the <b>paths property</b>.</p>
			<p>The paths property means that every number in Pascal's Triangle represents the number of paths to it from the top.</p>
