			<h1>What is Pascal's Triangle?</h1>
			<p>Pascal's Triangle is a triangle of numbers with many uses in math. Starting with a 1 surrounded by zeros, each number is found by adding the two above it.</p>
			<p>The first 5 rows of Pascal's Triangle:</p>
			<img src="http://www.teachingideas.co.uk/sites/default/files/pascalpic3.gif">
			<p>Pascal's Triangle has many useful properties and interesting patterns, which are described throughout this website.</p>
			<h1>Uses in Math:</h1>
			
			<h3>Binomial Coefficients</h3>
			<p>One property of Pascal's Triangle is that the rows represent coefficients of a binomial expansion. In other words, if you raise the binomial <i>(a + b)</i> to the power of <i>n</i>, the coefficients form the same sequence as row <i>n</i> of Pascal's Triangle.</p>
			<p>For example, (a + b)<sup>2</sup> works out to 1(a<sup>2</sup>) + 2(a<sup>1</sup>b<sup>1</sup>) + 1(b<sup>2</sup>). Row 2 of Pascal's Triangle is 1 2 1.</p>
			
			<h3>Combinatorics</h3>
			<p>Another cool thing about Pascal's triangle is that it directly represents the probability formula n choose k- often written as <i>nCk</i>. </p>
			<p><i>x = nCk</i> means that if you have a set of <i>n</i> things, there are <i>x</i> possible subsets of size <i>k</i>.</p>
			<p>For example, if I am selecting people from a group of 4- let's call them A, B, C, and D- there are 4 possible choices when I choose only one person.</p>
			<p>If I choose a group of two people, there are 6 possibilities- AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, and CD.</p>
			<p>The connection to Pascal's Triangle is simple- to find <i>nCk</i>, just check the number at row <i>n</i>, item <i>k</i> of the Triangle.</p>
			<p>*Remember that the first row, which is just a 1, is row 0, and the first item of every row is item 0.</p>
			
			<p></p>
			<h3>But Why?</h3>
			<p>So why does Pascal's Triangle have so many different applications?</p>
			<p>It may seem like a crazy coincidence, but all of these can be traced back to one particular property- the <b>paths property</b>.</p>
			<p>The paths property means that every number in Pascal's Triangle represents the number of paths to it from the top.</p>
			<img src="pictures/all three.png" width="750">
			<p>As you can see in these examples, there is one path to 1, two possible paths to 2, and 3 paths to 3.</p>
			<p>If you think about this, it makes sense. To reach a given number on the triangle, my path will have to include either the number to its top left, or to its top right. And once I reach one of those two, I only have one choice- move to my selected number.</p>
			<p>So, the number of paths to my number is equal to the sum of the two numbers above it- which is exactly how we find a new number!</p>
			
			<p>One application of the paths property is flipping coins. Say I flip a coin three times, and I am trying to get exactly two heads. How many different ways could this happen?</p>
			<p>This is related to paths because just like your choice of left or right at each row, a coin flip can go two ways. If we say that flipping heads means going left, and tails means right, the number of paths will be the number that is reached by going left a certain number of times and right a certain number of times.</p>
			<p>For my example, we want to flip heads twice and tails once, the number reached by LLR is 3. (The three possibilities are THH, HTH, and HHT.)</p>
			
			<h3>The Paths Property and Binomial Coefficients</h3>
			<p>Think about multiplying binomials, say, (<i>a + b</i>) * (<i>x + y</i>). Each resulting term is the product of exactly one item from each binomial.</p>
			<p>In my example, we could multiply these terms out to get <i>ax</i> + <i>ay</i> + <i>bx</i> + <i>by</i>.</p>
			<p>All of these terms have one factor from (<i>a + b</i>)- they contain either <i>a</i> or <i>b</i>, but not both, so you can think of this as 'choosing' one factor from each term.</p>
			<p>And if the only thing we're multiplying is (<i>a + b</i>), just repeated, a or b could represent left or right- a move on Pascal's Triangle... we're back at the paths property!</p>
