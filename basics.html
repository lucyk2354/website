			<h1>What is Pascal's Triangle?</h1>
			<p>Pascal's Triangle is a triangle of numbers with many uses in math. Starting with a 1 surrounded by zeros, each number is found by adding the two above it.</p>
			<p>The first 5 rows of Pascal's Triangle:</p>

			<p>Pascal's Triangle has many useful properties and interesting patterns, which are described throughout this website.</p>
			<h1>Uses in Math:</h1>
			<h3>Binomial coefficients</h3>
			<p>One property of Pascal's Triangle is that the rows represent coefficients of a binomial expansion. In other words, if you raise the binomial <i>(a + b)</i> to the power of <i>n</i>, the coefficients form the same sequence as row <i>n</i> of Pascal's Triangle.</p>
			<p>For example, (a + b)<sup>2</sup> works out to 1(a<sup>2</sup>) + 2(a<sup>1</sup>b<sup>1</sup>) + 1(b<sup>2</sup>). Row 2 of Pascal's Triangle is 1 2 1.</p>
			<h3>Combinatorics</h3>
			<p>Another cool thing about Pascal's triangle is that it directly represents the probability formula n choose k- often written as <i>nCk</i>. </p>
