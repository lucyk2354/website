		<p>Dog breeds vary quite a bit. Some dogs, like chihuahuas, are very small, growing to be only about 5 pounds. Other dog breeds, like Great Danes, are very big.</p>

		<p>Besides working as emotional support animals and helping people who are blind or deaf, dogs are used in police work, drug searches, and SAR (search and rescue).</p>

		<p>Dogs can be trained to sniff out drugs, working with policemen. They are helpful because of their amazing sense of smell.</p>

		<p>Dogs can also be firefighter dogs and rescue people from burning buildings. They are also used for search and rescue because they can smell people who are buried under snow or rubble.</p>
