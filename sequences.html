			<h1>Sequences- My Obsession</h1>
			
			<i><p>This page is a little different from the rest. It's a personal story, but it also has extra information about the Triangle.</p>
			<p>If you're not interested, you can stop reading here. For everyone else, let's get started!</p></i>
			<p></p>
			<p>I don't remember where I first heard of Pascal's Triangle. I knew about it before I learned some of the relevant math in school. For example, I didn't know about combinatorics (nCk) until 8th grade.</p>
			<p>I can't give exact dates here, but I've been interested in the Triangle for years. I liked messing around with it, doing different things with the numbers. I recently rediscovered a partially finished set of posters I had made about some basic properties of Pascal's Triangle.</p>
			<p>I liked discovering things, and I soon found a problem that captured my attention.</p>
			<p>*drumroll*</p>
			<h3>Sequences!</h3>
			<p>Basically, we're talking about the diagonals in Pascal's Triangle.</p>

			<p>In this image, I drew them right to left, but they can go either way since Pascal's Triangle is symmetrical.</p>
			<p>The first few are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Sequence 0 (just ones): 1 1 1 1 1</li>
				<li>Sequence 1 (counting numbers): 1 2 3 4 5</li>
				<li>Sequence 2 (triangular numbers): 1 3 6 10 15</li>
				<li>Sequence 3 (tetrahedral numbers): 1 4 10 20 35</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Properties</h3>
			<p>As you may have noticed in some of the names, the sequences are related to geometric formations.</p>
			<p>Specifically, sequence <i>n</i> represents a formation in <i>n</i> dimensions.</p>
			<p>Sequence 1 represents lines, and sequence 2 represents triangles.</p>
			<p>Here are some examples:</p>
