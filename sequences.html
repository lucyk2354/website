			<h1>Sequences- My Obsession</h1>
			
			<i><p>This page is a little different from the rest. It's a personal story, but it also has extra information about the Triangle.</p>
			<p>If you're not interested, you can stop reading here. For everyone else, let's get started!</p></i>
			<p></p>
			<p>I don't remember where I first heard of Pascal's Triangle. I knew about it before I learned some of the relevant math in school. For example, I didn't know about combinatorics (nCk) until 8th grade.</p>
			<p>I can't give exact dates here, but I've been interested in the Triangle for years. I liked messing around with it, doing different things with the numbers. I recently rediscovered a partially finished set of posters I had made about some basic properties of Pascal's Triangle.</p>
